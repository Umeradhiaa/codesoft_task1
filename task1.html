              <p>As a computer science student, I have a strong foundation in programming and a deep understanding of computer systems and technology. I am currently pursuing my degree in BSCS and have taken coursework in areas such as algorithms, data structures, programming languages, and software development. I have experience with languages such as SQL, Python, HTML, CSS, JavaScript and PHP . In addition, I have worked on several projects which have helped me develop skills in problem solving, critical thinking, and working in a team. Along with the education, I'm willing to gain experience in the practical field of computer science.</p>

            <h3> Rock-Paper-Scissors</h3>
            <p>We have developed an interactive Rock-Paper-Scissors game leveraging Arduino technology and sensors. In this game, participants engage by presenting one of the symbols related to Rock, Paper, or Scissors, which is then detected by a sensor. The Arduino processes the input and generates an output displayed through lights, each representing a different symbol: red for Rock, yellow for Paper, and green for Scissors. The outcome of the game is determined based on the comparison between the participant's input and a randomly generated output, providing an entertaining experience this project seamlessly blends hardware and software for an engaging experience. </p>
